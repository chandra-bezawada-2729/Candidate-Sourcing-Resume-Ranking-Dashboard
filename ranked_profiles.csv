Eduardo López-Pérez,Data Scientist | Researcher in Artificial Intelligence | B.Sc. Mathematics & B.Sc. Physics,https://es.linkedin.com/in/eduardolop,"Data Scientist | Researcher in Artificial Intelligence | B.Sc. Mathematics & B.Sc. Physics I am a Data Scientist and Researcher in Artificial Intelligence with 2+ year of experience. I have a background in Mathematics and Physics with a special focus in statistics. From that interest in statistics, I transitioned through data analysis and statistical modeling to machine learning and data science, where I found a field which really motivates me to learn more and more every day.

My current work involves using machine learning techniques to model industrial processes. I utilize a wide variety of algorithms such as SVMs, Gaussian Processes, Random Forests, Boosting methods or Deep Learning techniques, but my main focus is in Gaussian Processes due to their potential to be combined with Bayesian Optimization in order to optimize experimentation.

When working with industrial data, data quality can be a common issue, due to wrong measurements from sensors or other equipment, for this reason, working in outlier detection techniques and data filtering is also a significant amount of my work. Explainability in order to find the underlying physical relationships of each industrial process is something that I have done work on as well.

Apart from my current line of work, I have other scientific interests in fields such as finance, geopolitics, genomics and cybersecurity, and my goal is to strengthen my knowledge in each of those fields.

Long term plans: to continue learning new things about the fields I am interested in, and to work in high performance teams, facing new challenges.

Core values: integrity and respect, strong commitment, continuous improvement and innovation, focus on results.
